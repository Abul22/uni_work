It is all design and implement by myself, here is a [Youtube demo](http://youtu.be/Nn23Z1hW-3E) for Dream Catch, which is also my final presentation for this course.

Please notcied, it is** not in App Store** and only part of the souce code are in github, so it will **not running** if you just download it.

This is a really good assignement for learning operating system, and it is all build on [OS/161](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~syrah/os161/), please chick the link to find more about it.

>In this assignment you will implement synchronization primitives for OS/161 and learn how to use them to solve several synchronization problems. Once you have completed the written and programming exercises you should have a fairly solid grasp of the pitfalls of concurrent programming and, more importantly, how to avoid those pitfalls in the code you will write later this semester. To complete this assignment you will need to be familiar with the OS/161 thread code. The thread system provides interrupts,control functions, and semaphores. You will implement locks and condition variables.

These is the task list which I have done:

* Implement locks
* Implement condition variables
* The Whale Mating Problem - solved
* Bathroom Synchronization - solved

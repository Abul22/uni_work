This is a [Connect 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game written by C, and run it right away:

	
```
$ make
$ ./c4
```	

You will see when you did the make that only 2 agent players have been found:

 * Found agent 'random'
 * Found agent 'simple'
 * Found agent 'chao'


Hence, when you run it you will be able to select just 3 type of
players: chao, random, simple, or human.

The agent 'chao' is implement by me for this assignment, I **ONLY** implement `agent_chao.c`, rest of files are all produce by [RMIT](http://www.rmit.edu.au/).
